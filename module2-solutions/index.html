			<p class="para1">Chicken</p>
		Butter chicken is the classic Indian truck stop dish that’s as straightforward as it sounds: Chicken gets cooked in a tomato and butter gravy (or literally just butter) until the meat is fall-off-the-bone soft. Butter chicken will often look very similar to chicken tikka masala.

			<p class="para2">Beef</p>
		Meat flavor is a function of the sensory sensations of odor and taste. Odor has many different chemical components due to release of volatiles, while taste is sweet, salty, sour, bitter, and the savory characteristic of meat umami. This dish is not so prevalent in India.
